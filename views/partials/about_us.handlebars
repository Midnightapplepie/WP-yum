Many dishes and cooking techniques stem from recipes passed on from generation to generation and have a history originating in Northern and Central China. The regions of Sichuan and Beijing are the heart of Xiao Loong's cuisine and can be recognized by the different uses of aromatics, spices, and cooking styles. Dishes prepared in the Sichuan and Beijing style are characterized by spicy and pungent flavors, with an emphasis on strong flavored roots and vegetables such as peppers, garlic, and ginger as well as a prolific amount of chilis and spicy sauces. You will find traditional fare including Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Potstickers, but you will also find innovative items like Prawns with Chinese Chive Dumplings, Spicy Chili Prawns, and Xiao Loong Beef.
